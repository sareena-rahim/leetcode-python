## üëã About Me

Hi! I'm Sareena Rahim.

Curiosity about AI first drew me to Python, but along the way, I discovered something even bigger, a genuine love for learning and creating through code.

I‚Äôm learning Python from scratch, and there‚Äôs nothing quite like the thrill of cracking a problem after hours of effort. That moment when everything clicks, when the code runs exactly as you envisioned, feels like pure magic.

What excites me most about programming is that it never stops teaching you. There‚Äôs always a more elegant solution to discover, a new concept that shifts your perspective, or a tiny tweak that transforms everything. The deeper I dive, the more fascinated I become with AI, the idea that we can build systems that learn, adapt, and solve problems we haven‚Äôt even imagined yet.

I‚Äôm working towards:

- Building projects that genuinely impact people

- Exploring AI and understanding how intelligent systems really work

- Creating solutions that make a difference, however small

I embrace every stumble and breakthrough along the way. The challenges make the victories sweeter, and I‚Äôm learning to love the journey as much as the progress.
